<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Guanqiao (Gabriel) Chen, a Computer Science student at New York University, expecting to graduate in 2026 with a Bachelor of Science degree. I have been honored with the Dean's List for 2024 and 2025. My coursework includes Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Software Engineering (Agile), Database Systems, Computer Networking, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Optimization, and Stochastic Process.

I am passionate about building scalable distributed systems, agentic AI, and machine learning. My experience spans software engineering internships at major companies including HSBC and Johnson & Johnson, where I worked on AI automation platforms and agentic systems.

- Applied Reinforcement Learning loop (evaluate, refine, compose) to turn customer prompts into BPMN workflows and UI pages.
- Exposed Jira, Confluence, and CR as ADK tools with idempotency, RBAC, OAuth2 SA, circuit-breakers, and audit logs.
- Implemented RAG with PGVector + BM25 hybrid search, schema-aware chunking, and Pydantic-typed outputs.
- Added Redis caching for embeddings, top-k retrieval, and responses using TTL and key hashing.

## Johnson & Johnson
**Software Engineer Intern | AI in Digital and Automation Solutions** | *May 2024 - Aug 2024*
- Built an internal AI agent with LangChain, FastAPI, WebSockets, TTS for knowledge retrieval across digital-twin platform.
- Added Redis with LangChain long-term memory to persist conversation state and keep multi-turn incident workflows coherent.
- Implemented Qdrant-backed RAG combining internal data with web signals, boosting accuracy and cutting hallucinations ~35%.
- Leveraged SerpAPI to aggregate web searches, applying filtering and ranking techniques to prioritize search results.

## Deloitte
**Data Engineer Intern | Data Engineer in Financial Advisory** | *Aug 2023 - Aug 2023*
